# predict_heart_disease_machine_learning_project

**Overview**

This project uses the Cleveland Heart Disease UCI dataset located on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).  

The project notebook includes code, visualizations, and interesting facts about heart disease and its contributing factors.

The goals of the project are to:

    1. Perform exploratory data analysis
    2. Apply a predictive machine learning algorithm 

**About the dataset**

The UCI repository contains three datasets on heart disease. 

Each dataset contains information about several patients suspected of having heart disease such as whether or not the patient is a smoker, the patient's resting heart rate, age, gender, etc. 

The patients were all tested for heart disease and the results of that tests are given as numbers ranging from 0 (no heart disease) to 4 (severe heart disease).
