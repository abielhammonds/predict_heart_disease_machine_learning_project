# predict_heart_disease_machine_learning_project

Overview
This project uses the Cleveland Heart Disease UCI dataset located on Kaggle.  

The goals of the project are to:
    1. Perform exploratory data analysis
    2. Apply a predictive machine learning algorithm 

About the dataset
The UCI repository contains three datasets on heart disease. Each dataset contains information about several patients suspected of having heart disease such as whether or not the patient is a smoker, the patients resting heart rate, age, sex, etc. The patients were all tested for heart disease and the results of that tests are given as numbers ranging from 0 (no heart disease) to 4 (severe heart disease).
