    "1. Size of the training data (small in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "    if the training data is smal or if the dataset has a small number of observations/high number of features \n",
    "    choose algorithms with high bias/low variance like Linear regression, Naïve Bayes, or Linear SVM.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If the training data is large and the number of observations is higher, compared to the number of \n",
    "    features, you can use low bias/high variance algorithms like KNN, Decision trees, or kernel SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Desired Accuracy and/or Interpretability of the output (interpretability in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accuracy of a model means that the function predicts a response value for a given observation, which is \n",
    "    close to the true response value for that observation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    A highly interpretable algorithm (restrictive models like Linear Regression) means that one can easily \n",

    "3.  Speed or Training time (non-issue for this small dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Higher accuracy typically means higher training time. Also, algorithms require more time to train on \n",
    "    large training data. In real-world applications, the choice of algorithm is driven by these two factors \n",
    "    predominantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Algorithms like Naïve Bayes and Linear and Logistic regression are easy to implement and quick to run. \n",
    "    Algorithms like SVM, which involve tuning of parameters, Neural networks with high convergence time, and \n",
    "    random forests, need a lot of time to train the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Linearity (to be determined)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The best way to find out the linearity is to either fit a linear line or run a logistic regression or SVM \n",
    "    and check for residual errors. A higher error means the data is not linear and would need complex \n",
    "    algorithms to fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Number of features (small in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dataset may have a large number of features that may not all be relevant and significant. For a \n",
    "    certain type of data, such as genetics or textual, the number of features can be very large compared to \n",

    "\n",
    "6. Supervised or Unsupervised learning (Supervised in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Supervised learning algorithms are used when the training data has output variables corresponding to the \n",
    "   input variables. The algorithm analyses the input data and learns a function to map the relationship \n",
    "   between the input and output variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Unspervised learning algorithms are used when the training data does not have a response variable. Such \n",
